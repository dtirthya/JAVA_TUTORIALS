        //Expression is anything when we declare or assign a value to a variable.
        //Statement is a line of code
        //For example,
        int a = 10;
        //Here, "int" is a keyword, "a" is an identifier, "a = 10" is an Expression and "int a = 10;" is a statement.
        //For example,
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        //Here, "System.out.println" is a keyword (We are calling a method here), "Hello world" is an expression and "System.out.println("Hello world");" is a statement.
        //Note: We can put multiple statements in one line. For example,
        int b = 20;int c = a + b;System.out.println("The sum of a and b is " + c);
